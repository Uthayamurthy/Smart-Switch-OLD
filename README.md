# Smart Switch - OLD Code 

> ## This repository contains the old code [more than 3-4 yrs old] of the smart switch project - Don't Use this for any practical purposes ... just here for archival purposes.

## What is it ?
It is a smart switch, powered by ESP32 and Micropython !! Uses Mqtt protocol.
Look at the demo videos for more information -
- Demo 1 - (https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Lqepesy4jmlXIludRf4tuY9v5rOwGqv/view?usp=sharing)
- Demo 2 - (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQ8gN4AxpAoVK3YVnuBNmksyoojFIXlm/view?usp=sharing)

## In case you want to run it -
Copy the files in the ESP32 directory to ESP32, copy the files in raspberry pi to the pi, create a service using the template and don't forget to add the right details in the config files.
Parts used (for switch)) -
- ESP32
- Relay Module - 2 channel [Use according to your needs]
- AC (220V) to DC(5V) Module
- A couple of LEDs and a buzzer module for status indication.
- PIR Sensor [optional, for Motion Light]

Connection is pretty straight forward, do according to your wish and modify the config files accordingly ...
